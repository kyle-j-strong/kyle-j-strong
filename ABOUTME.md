Hello!

My name is Kyle and I am a Software Engineering student at Sheridan College. I live just outside Toronto and am currently 23 years old. My favourite 
niche of development is interactive applications using libraries such as 3JS. I truly believe it is the future of websites.

I am trained in various languages including Java, Javascript, MYSQL, HTML, CSS, and I am currently indulging in C# and PHP. 

I am currently looking for a Summer 2022 Internship at an inspiring company where I can bring my skills and expand my knowledge!
